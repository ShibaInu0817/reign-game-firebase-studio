# **App Name**: Survival Swipe

## Core Features:

- Home Screen: Home screen with a "Start Game" button to begin the adventure.
- Card Engine: Presents random scenario cards with left/right choices that affect stats. Story scripts should be easy to edit, and rapidly prototyped via JSON
- Stats System: Display and manage survival stats (Health, Shelter, Supplies, Morale). The UI shall also reflect winning and losing status, as indicated by changes to the stats..
- Game Over Screen: Game over screen showing the number of days survived and an option to restart.
- Story File Format: Use a JSON format to define card content, choices, and stat changes. No need for actual editing tools as that is outside the scope of an MVP.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated cyan (#73A8FF) to create a somber and tense mood reflective of survival, in a dark color scheme.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated cyan (#192A3D), providing a muted backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted, brighter green (#98E67B), approximately 30 degrees away from cyan, used for elements needing more emphasis.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), used for its modern yet slightly edgy feel, for headlines. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for any longer text.
- Simple, minimalist icons to represent stats and choices.
- Card-based layout optimized for mobile with clear distinctions between information and actions.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without distracting from gameplay.
